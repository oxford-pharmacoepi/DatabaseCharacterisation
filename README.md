This code provides the tools to characterise a database mapped to the OMOP Common Data Model.

This repo is organized as follows:
- [Study](https://github.com/oxford-pharmacoepi/DatabaseCharacterisation/blob/main/Study/): please find there the relevant code to obtain the study results.
- [Report](https://github.com/oxford-pharmacoepi/DatabaseCharacterisation/blob/main/Report/): please find there the code to visualise the results with the shiny app and generate the report with the plots and tables.

An example of the generated shiny app run with synthetic data can be found in: [https://dpa-pde-oxford.shinyapps.io/databaseCharacterisation/](https://dpa-pde-oxford.shinyapps.io/databaseCharacterisation/).
